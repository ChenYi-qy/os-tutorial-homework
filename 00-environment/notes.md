## Our overall footesteps
Here, concentrating on the widely used x86 architecture, we will strip bare our computer of all software, learning along the way about:
* How a computer boots
* How to write low-level programs in the barren landscape where no operating systems yet exists
* How to configure CPU so that we can begin to use its extended functionnality
* How to bootstrap code writen in higher-level language, so that we can really start to make some programs towards our own operating system
* How to create some fundmental operating system services, such as device services, file systems, multi-tasking processing

## Tools you need to familar:
nasm: an assembler for the x86 CPU architecture portable to nearly every modern platform.

qemu: a free and open-source hypervisor(a kind of emulator), it emulates the machine's processor 
through dynamic binary translation and provides a set of different hardware and device models for
the machine.

## Tasks:
* Install nasm -> sudo apt-get install nasm(ubuntu)
* Get familar with concepts like: linux, terminal, compiler, emulator, nasm, qemu
